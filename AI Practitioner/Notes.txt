What is artificial intelligence ? 
-Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science dedicated to solving problems that we 
commonly associate with human intelligence.
for eg.Image creation , image recognition , speech-to-text

How does AI work ?
-There is a training data set.Which is taken by a data scientist generally to train the AI model.
-Training AI model is some code that has some statistical abilities and a AI model is born out
of it.
For eg. A data scientist takes a data set like fruits.Places them on AI graph grouping similar
kind of fruits together.Placing group of apples at one place in a graph , placing group of bananas in another place in graph and training the AI model on it.
-We as a User of this AI model , when we give a new image of apple , which was never seen by AI before , the AI , based on the data it was trained should be able to recognize that the user provided image is of a Apple.

History of AI :-
1)In 1950s this was the birth of AI.Alan Turing , who is a mathamatician  , proposes something called as turing test.
-The Turing test proposes that , the machine has intelligence if its able to have a conversation with a human , and fool the human making it think that the human is speaking to another human.
-So if the computer can pretend its a human and a human cannot detect this , then we have achieved artifical intelligence.
-John Mccarthy , who is also one of the father of artificial intelligence , who just invented the term.
2)In 1970s , we have whats called expert systems.Expert systems are like the mycin expert systems
which is an AI rule based system to detect bacterias.
-It was one of the first AI , which would say you have this bacteria and then we propose some kind of treatments.
3)In 1990s , we have the new field of machine learning and data mining.In this we can collect data , organize it , and we start to have statistical breakthroughs in math that allows us to design algorithms to start doing machine learning.
4)In 1997 , Deep Blue was introduced by IBM.IBM's deep blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
-It does it by doing a lot of computations , analyzing the best moves and playing.
5)In 2010s , we have the Deep learning revolution.This is where we have neural networks , and the type of algorithms that we see in modern AI.
-And so , in 2016 , there is google which creates a algorithm and AI named alphaGo , defeating the Go world champion , Lee Sedol in 2016.
6)In 2020s , we have AI in everyday life like virtual assistants , autonomous vehicles and healthcare diagnostics.

AI Use Cases :-
1)Transcribe and transalte spoken language.
2)Playing humans in games(chess , go , starcraft etc).
3)Speech recognition and generation
4)Driving cars , flying airplanes
5)Suggest code for developers(copilot).
6)Automating business processes
7)Fraud detection

AI Practical Example :-
Intelligent document processing
-Say we have a invoice  , and we need to extract the information out of invoice and insert it into our system.
-Here we can leverage AI which is specialized in Intelligent document processing.
-There are many sub AI techniques leveraged here like computer vision , deep learning , natural language processing.

Cloud Computing :-
-Cloud computing is on demand delivery of IT resources like compute power, database storage, applications over the internet.
-Through a cloud service platform with pay-as-you go pricing.

Five characteristics of cloud computing :-
1)On-demnad self service :-
-Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider.
2)Broad network access :-
-Resources available over the network , and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.
3)Multi-tenancy and resource pooling :-
-Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with securtiy and privacy
4)Rapid elasticity and scalability:-
-Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed.
-Quickly and easily scale based on demand
5)Measured service :-
-Usage is measured and users pay exactly for what they have used.

Six advantages of cloud computing :-
1)Trade capital expense(CAPEX) for operational expense(OPEX). i.e CAPEX for OPEX
-Pay on demand and dont own hardware
-Reduced total cost of ownserhsip(TCO) and operational expense(OPEX).
2)Benefit from massive economies of scale
-Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale.
3)Stop guessing capacity
-Scale based on actual measured usage
4)Increased speed and agility
5)Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
6)Go global in minutes:Leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Types of cloud computing :-
1)Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) :-
-Provide building blocks for cloud IT
-Provides networking , computers data storage space
-Highest level of flexibility
-Easy parallel with traditional on prem IT  
2)Platform as a service(Paas) :-
-Removes the need for organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
-Focus on deployment and management of your applications
3)Software as a service(Saas):-
-Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
